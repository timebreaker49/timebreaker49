- 👋 Hi, I’m @timebreaker49, a web developer currently working on django + react projects (follow me on waynecodes.com)
- 🤠 I’m currently based in ATX~
- 👀 I’m interested in payments system technology and i18n, and outside of programming, music (playing+/listening), reading, anime+/manga, and video games.
- 🌱 I'm playing around with a lot of concepts to try and find an area I want to really dig into
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to payments, i18n, or social justice work
